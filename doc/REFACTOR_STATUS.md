# Citlali Refactor Status

This is the living roadmap and completion ledger for the Citlali refactor.
Update it when a phase gate, governing decision, or validated snapshot changes.

## Governing Decision

On 2026-07-10 the project formally adopted the five-phase roadmap from the
[independent architecture review](../handoff/EXTERNAL_REFACTOR_ARCHITECTURE_REVIEW_2026-07-10.md).
The review verdict, **sound with material reservations**, is accepted.

The original [structural refactor plan](STRUCTURAL_REFACTOR_PLAN_2026-06-29.md)
remains the historical statement of intent. This document governs current
sequencing and exit criteria where the original plan differs.

The project will improve the existing tree incrementally. It will not restart
as a broad rewrite and will not rewrite the granular history of the validated
branch. The exact validated tree will remain available for forensic review.

## Current Snapshot

- Refactor baseline: `376e0022`.
- Production code inspected by the external review: `84670829`.
- Latest inspected point reduction: `redu22`, produced by `84670829`.
- `redu21` and `redu22` had exact common numeric products with complete TOD
  comparison, but both contained 12 logged NetCDF errors.
- The same YAML produced two provenance changes in `redu22`: an effective IIR
  default appeared for a disabled filter and an extinction sentinel changed.
- Local `citlali_cli` build and compact-config preflight pass.
- The inspected local build discovers zero tests because tests are disabled.

These facts are characterization evidence, not a production-equivalence claim.

## Active Phase

**Phase 1 - Safety stabilization** is active.

Pause further typed analysis-control migration, compact-config production
rollout, and open-ended file splitting. Narrow work that repairs safety
contracts, activates tests, clarifies authority, or prepares a measured
compiled boundary remains in scope.

Project-owner decision (2026-07-10): every output explicitly enabled in the
configuration is required. RTC TOD, PTC TOD, `rtcdiag`, and `ptcdiag` write
failures must fail the reduction. There are no best-effort enabled products.

Immediate work order:

1. Diagnose and eliminate the recurring RTC/PTC NetCDF errors.
2. Propagate required output failures and make ordered output cancellation-safe.
3. Make enum parse failures and non-finite values hard validation failures.
4. Restore correct disabled-IIR and extinction provenance semantics.
5. Activate focused tests for failure propagation, cancellation, invalid
   config, and repeated runs in one process.
6. Establish a strict, complete point comparator and a zero-unexpected-errors
   audit gate.
7. Record current matched OG/refactor baselines for point, beammap, science,
   and OOF before advancing the architecture again.

### Phase 1 Progress

- The 12 `NetCDF: Not a valid ID` errors in `redu21`/`redu22` were traced to
  the PTC TOD stream, one error per requested output scan. The schema omitted
  four second-pass rejection/source-protection variables that the append path
  wrote unconditionally. Signal, flags, weights, and earlier diagnostics had
  already been written before each exception, which explains why pairwise
  numeric comparison passed despite incomplete diagnostics.
- The PTC TOD schema now includes all four fields. A focused NetCDF schema test
  creates the file layout and checks their presence. Local `citlali_cli` build
  and `citlali::safety::ptc_tod_schema.includes_all_second_pass_summary_fields`
  pass. Unity reduction validation is pending.
- CTest is now enabled at the project boundary and the focused safety target is
  discoverable from the normal top-level build directory.
- Parsed enum failures now enter the authoritative invalid-key diagnostics
  instead of silently retaining their typed default. Legacy authoritative
  range parsing and typed validation reject NaN and infinity for ordinary
  numeric fields. The four documented line-frequency inheritance fields retain
  their explicit NaN sentinel but reject either infinity. Focused parser and
  finite-value tests pass locally.
- Required RTC TOD, PTC TOD, `rtcdiag`, and `ptcdiag` NetCDF failures now retain
  the failing path in an error diagnostic and propagate out of the reduction.
  Ordered writers cancel as one output domain, so a failure wakes workers
  waiting on the same or another product stream instead of deadlocking. Focused
  serialization, cancellation, and cross-stream cancellation tests pass
  locally; a CLI-level injected-write test remains part of the Phase 1 exit
  gate.
- The pre-existing `citlali_test` target was found to have substantial test
  infrastructure and source decay. It remains a separate Phase 1 repair item;
  the focused safety target does not conceal that debt or satisfy the complete
  test-activation gate by itself.

## Five-Phase Roadmap

### Phase 1 - Safety Stabilization

Repair output and run-success contracts, config parsing and finite-value
validation, output schema/cardinality checks, and ordered-writer cancellation.
Add injected failure and repeated-run tests without rewriting mature numerical
algorithms.

Exit gates:

- An injected required write failure returns a nonzero CLI status.
- Ordered output cannot deadlock after failure, and partial products have an
  explicit diagnosed disposition.
- A subsequent reduction in the same process starts with clean state.
- Invalid enums, NaN, and infinity fail with actionable config paths.
- The current point run has zero unexpected error-level messages and passes a
  strict complete-TOD and metadata comparison.

### Phase 2 - Config Authority And Provenance

Build the one-way flow from immutable requested config to effective execution
plan to realized observation metadata, with a temporary one-way legacy adapter.
Fix disabled-option provenance, atomic observation config, stale beammap flux
state, and typed/legacy parity checks. Validate real TolTECA overlay behavior
before compact config becomes operational.

Exit gates are the complete current-config definition of done in section F.1 of
the external review, including one authority per migrated field, no fallback to
raw YAML in migrated execution paths, correct provenance, and reviewed overlay
fixtures for each supported reduction mode.

### Phase 3 - Library, Session, And First Compiled Boundary

Introduce a minimal non-CLI reduction session/result boundary, remove reachable
library exits, give run/observation/scan state explicit owners, and freeze
`Engine` as a compatibility adapter. Add header-isolation and multi-translation-
unit checks, repair ODR hazards, and move one measured, coherent declaration and
validation tranche into `.cpp` files.

Exit gates:

- CLI policy is outside the library boundary.
- Sequential reductions in one process are clean and supported.
- Lifecycle state is reset by ownership rather than scattered cleanup.
- The first compiled boundary reduces dependency exposure without a material
  build or runtime regression.
- Further extraction has a named ownership or contract benefit; textual
  subdivision alone is not sufficient.

### Phase 4 - Validation, Performance, And Reproducible Build

Make strict comparison and active tests pinned CI gates. Add hermetic fixtures,
version/dependency provenance, current matched mode baselines, and controlled
beammap timing and peak-memory evidence. Establish polarimetry support or an
explicit capability policy before release claims.

Exit gates are the broader structural definition of done in section F.2 of the
external review: strict scientific equivalence, zero unexpected errors,
reproducible builds, measured performance, and documented scientific
conventions.

### Phase 5 - Integration And Closeout

Consolidate canonical architecture and scientific-convention documentation,
the validation ledger, and the intended-science-change manifest. Mark or remove
legacy/stub paths, tag the forensic refactor branch, and integrate the exact
validated tree. Add install/export support only if external library consumption
is an accepted project goal.

Core RTC/PTC algorithm cleanup, broad compact-config rollout, and R execution
are follow-up projects unless their prerequisites are explicitly brought into
this roadmap.

## Stop And Defer Rules

- Stop splitting files when a split has no clear owner, contract, test seam, or
  dependency benefit.
- Do not broadly rewrite RTC/PTC, JINC, or Wiener-filter numerical kernels in
  this refactor.
- Do not make compact config authoritative before TolTECA overlay acceptance.
- Do not implement R execution before a measured-channel data contract exists.
- Do not add concurrent reductions as a requirement unless the project owner
  explicitly needs them; sequential same-process reentrancy is required.
- Do not squash or rewrite the only validated branch history.

## Decisions Requiring Scientific Ownership

Ask the project owner when implementation first depends on an answer. Do not
silently choose among these:

- Which output products are required versus optional in each reduction mode.
- Which TOD types are supported and how unknown values must fail.
- How disabled filters and extinction states appear in requested, effective,
  and realized provenance.
- The exact meaning of hardware-polarization ignore/enable controls and whether
  polarimetry is a supported release capability.
- Allowed calibration or analysis fallbacks and their required diagnostics.
- Canonical detector/network/array identities, coordinate frames, units,
  missing-value sentinels, and table schemas.
- Beammap source-flux fallback and reset behavior.
- OOF scientific intent and the acceptance tolerances for each mode.
- Whether any future caller needs concurrent reductions in one process.
- The measured-channel contract and missing-data policy for future R analysis.
- Whether Citlali must be installable and consumable as an external library.

## Durable Evidence

The project still needs a machine-readable validation ledger recording commit,
binary version, mode, input/config identity, comparator version, tolerances,
error count, timing, peak memory, and disposition. Until it exists, update this
document and the dated handoff note with each accepted gate result.
