# Citlali Refactor Status

This is the living roadmap and completion ledger for the Citlali refactor.
Update it when a phase gate, governing decision, or validated snapshot changes.

## Governing Decision

On 2026-07-10 the project formally adopted the five-phase roadmap from the
[independent architecture review](../handoff/EXTERNAL_REFACTOR_ARCHITECTURE_REVIEW_2026-07-10.md).
The review verdict, **sound with material reservations**, is accepted.

The original [structural refactor plan](STRUCTURAL_REFACTOR_PLAN_2026-06-29.md)
remains the historical statement of intent. This document governs current
sequencing and exit criteria where the original plan differs.

The project will improve the existing tree incrementally. It will not restart
as a broad rewrite and will not rewrite the granular history of the validated
branch. The exact validated tree will remain available for forensic review.

## Current Snapshot

- Refactor baseline: `376e0022`.
- Production code inspected by the external review: `84670829`.
- Latest inspected point reduction: `redu27`, produced by `0dc08555`.
- `redu23` and `redu24` completed all 12 PTC chunks with zero error-level log
  records and complete TOD/diagnostic products. Their common numeric products,
  FITS maps, and pointing tables are exact; only profiling timing differs.
- `redu21` and `redu22` had exact common numeric products with complete TOD
  comparison, but both contained 12 logged NetCDF errors.
- The same YAML exposed two provenance defects in `redu22`: an effective IIR
  default appeared for a disabled filter and an extinction sentinel changed.
  `redu25` validates the intended disabled-state provenance correction with
  exact scientific products.
- Local `citlali_cli` build and compact-config preflight pass.
- CTest discovers and passes 201 legacy tests plus 18 focused safety tests,
  with none skipped or disabled.

These facts are characterization evidence, not a production-equivalence claim.

## Active Phase

**Phase 2 - Config authority and provenance** is active as of 2026-07-11.

Phase 1 safety stabilization is complete for the currently available point,
Beammap, and science validation modes. OOF validation is explicitly deferred
by the project owner until its workflow is available, expected during the week
after 2026-07-11; because OOF closely follows pointing, that deferral does not
block Phase 2. It remains a required validation before final integration.

Operational config migration must proceed one authority domain at a time with
the one-way requested-to-effective-to-realized contract, focused tests, and the
existing mode gates. Compact-config production rollout and open-ended file
splitting remain out of scope.

The runtime domain is the first operational Phase 2 migration. Requested,
effective, and realized runtime state are now separate in memory, and execution
consumes the effective thread and runtime policy. Remaining direct mutable
runtime reads are confined to config construction. The required, atomically
published `runtime_provenance.yaml` sidecar uses the stable
`citlali-runtime-provenance-v1` schema. Unity `redu27` validates the sidecar,
zero serious log issues, and exact pre-existing point products. The runtime
domain is complete; the next operational domain is timestream output selection
and chunking.

The timestream-output domain routes RTC/PTC output shape, outer-buffer
allocation, NetCDF serialization mode, metadata, selection, and scan-index
construction through typed configuration. The required, atomically published
per-observation `timestream_output_provenance.yaml` carries the versioned
requested/effective/realized output record. Unity `redu28` validates all 12
selected and realized RTC/PTC chunks, both registered TOD files, zero serious
log issues, and exact existing products. The former processor output-mode and
telescope chunking mirrors are removed; parser and writer boundaries receive
typed values explicitly. The local CLI/test build, all 229 tests, and full
config preflight pass. This domain is complete.

Work has started on the `raw-timestream` domain. Downsample enablement,
requested factor/frequency, anti-alias validation, and effective sample-rate
preflight now use typed raw-time-chunk configuration. Frequency-derived factors
are synchronized into the RTC downsampler only as an execution adapter. A
divergence test proves typed policy wins over stale processor mirrors. Typed
policy also controls FIR/notch/IIR setup, kernel-dependent allocation and
products, flux-unit selection, and extinction setup; processor objects retain
the corresponding numerical state. All 231 tests pass. Remaining RTC flagging,
source-protection, line-audit, and diagnostics boundaries are being migrated in
bounded clusters.

Raw source-protection activation now flows requested typed policy to realized
typed state and then to the RTC execution adapter. Learned-mask application,
FITS event-mask provenance, and RTC diagnostic impulsive-product shape consume
typed policy directly. The shared processed source-protection activation follows
the same direction. All 232 tests pass; line-audit and remaining diagnostic
configuration are the next raw-timestream clusters.

The line-audit cluster now uses typed policy for model-protected PTC audit
activation, model-subtraction requirements, notch-family selection, iteration
counts, frequency overrides, and dynamic edge-guard decisions. RTC diagnostic
sidecars, TOD headers, and chunk summaries serialize requested raw settings from
typed config. Existing RTC notch methods still consume the processor options
object as a numerical adapter, and realized edge-context/guard sample counts
remain processor state. The CLI build, all 232 tests, and full config preflight
pass.

Raw input and metadata boundaries now use typed policy for duplicate-tone
frequency separation, RTC diagnostic FIR/source-bandwidth ratios, and whether
FITS/TOD tau metadata is calculated. The atmospheric calibration object remains
processor-owned numerical state. The CLI build, all 232 tests, and full config
preflight pass.

RTC diagnostic and RTC TOD diagnostic schema construction now receives typed
downsample and impulsive-capture policy explicitly. External raw product-shape
decisions no longer depend on `RTCProc` mirrors. Remaining raw-timestream work
is concentrated in numerical-method adapters internal to `RTCProc`; polarimetry
is tracked as a separate authority domain.

The first processed-timestream authority slice now routes fruit-loop
enablement, effective iteration count, retained-iteration output layout,
initial/previous model-map paths, and learning source-model availability
through typed fruit-loop config. Beammap and disabled-loop normalization is
recorded in typed effective state and copied into `PTCProc` only as an execution
adapter. All 232 tests and the full config preflight pass.

Processed-timestream orchestration now also uses typed fruit-loop policy for
model subtraction/add-back, source-subtracted weight retention, final noise-map
population, and beammap adaptive-gate setup. Processor state remains the home
of runtime model buffers and numerical kernels, but no longer decides whether
these operations are enabled. All 233 tests and the full config preflight pass.
Interpolation override selection and fruit-loop runtime-policy logging now use
the same typed authority; the processor retains only the realized interpolation
mode required by map-to-TOD execution. All 234 tests pass.

Project-owner decision (2026-07-10): every output explicitly enabled in the
configuration is required. RTC TOD, PTC TOD, `rtcdiag`, and `ptcdiag` write
failures must fail the reduction. There are no best-effort enabled products.

Immediate work order:

1. Complete Unity validation of the required-output and provenance fixes.
2. Make enum parse failures and non-finite values hard validation failures.
3. Activate focused tests for failure propagation, cancellation, invalid
   config, and repeated runs in one process.
4. Establish a strict, complete point comparator and a zero-unexpected-errors
   audit gate.
5. Record current matched OG/refactor baselines for point, beammap, science,
   and OOF before advancing the architecture again.

### Phase 1 Progress

- The 12 `NetCDF: Not a valid ID` errors in `redu21`/`redu22` were traced to
  the PTC TOD stream, one error per requested output scan. The schema omitted
  four second-pass rejection/source-protection variables that the append path
  wrote unconditionally. Signal, flags, weights, and earlier diagnostics had
  already been written before each exception, which explains why pairwise
  numeric comparison passed despite incomplete diagnostics.
- The PTC TOD schema now includes all four fields. A focused NetCDF schema test
  creates the file layout and checks their presence. Local `citlali_cli` build
  and `citlali::safety::ptc_tod_schema.includes_all_second_pass_summary_fields`
  pass. Unity reduction validation is pending.
- CTest is now enabled at the project boundary and the focused safety target is
  discoverable from the normal top-level build directory.
- Parsed enum failures now enter the authoritative invalid-key diagnostics
  instead of silently retaining their typed default. Legacy authoritative
  range parsing and typed validation reject NaN and infinity for ordinary
  numeric fields. The four documented line-frequency inheritance fields retain
  their explicit NaN sentinel but reject either infinity. Focused parser and
  finite-value tests pass locally.
- Required RTC TOD, PTC TOD, `rtcdiag`, and `ptcdiag` NetCDF failures now retain
  the failing path in an error diagnostic and propagate out of the reduction.
  Ordered writers cancel as one output domain, so a failure wakes workers
  waiting on the same or another product stream instead of deadlocking. Focused
  serialization, cancellation, and cross-stream cancellation tests pass.
- A real fixed-size NetCDF failure test now writes the first row, injects an
  out-of-range second write, verifies that a waiting third writer is cancelled
  and the partial product is explicit, confirms a nonzero CLI result, then
  recreates and completes the product with a fresh writer domain in the same
  process.
- The owner-thread failure state now lets Pointing, Lali, and Beammap rethrow
  required output failures after GrPPI worker drainage, so the normal CLI error
  boundary can report them without an exception escaping a worker thread.
- Disabled IIR and extinction mirrors now preserve legacy effective provenance:
  IIR uses frequency `0`/order `1`/zero-phase `false`, and extinction uses
  `N/A`. Enabled values are unchanged. Four focused mirror tests pass.
- Reduction audit comparison now treats any error-level log record as blocking;
  `redu22` correctly fails the audit with 12 errors while the clean `redu23` to
  `redu24` comparison passes.
- Reduction product comparison now has an explicit strict mode. It fails on
  product-set differences, skipped items, or changed records. A complete TOD
  comparison of `redu23` and `redu24` passes with zero changes/skips when the
  volatile profile sidecar is explicitly excluded; retaining that sidecar or
  the default large-array cap correctly fails the gate.
- The pre-existing `citlali_test` target was found to have substantial test
  infrastructure and source decay. It has now been decoupled from the obsolete
  Google Benchmark runner, modernized for typed config and explicit alignment
  and output-path ownership, and reactivated with all 201 declared legacy tests
  passing. The seven utility tests that had remained inside a block comment now
  exercise the current Tula APIs with assertions. Together with the 18 focused
  safety tests, CTest discovers and passes 219 tests with none skipped or
  disabled. The local CLI build and complete config preflight continue to pass.
- Enabled timestream products now carry mode- and config-derived expected write
  counts. Pointing, Lali, and Beammap verify RTC TOD, PTC TOD, `rtcdiag`, and
  `ptcdiag` cardinality after worker drainage and before map finalization, so a
  silently omitted required chunk fails even when no individual write throws.
- Main timestream scan generators now own their cursors per pipeline invocation
  instead of sharing function-local static counters. Focused tests prove exact
  enumeration and a clean scan-zero start after an earlier cursor is abandoned.
- `redu25` (`c2ec8ae5`) finished with zero serious log issues and the same
  complete 33-file/14 stable-product inventory as `redu24`. Scientific arrays,
  maps, and tables are exact. The only strict-comparison differences are the
  intended disabled-IIR effective-provenance changes in RTC/PTC metadata.
- Beammap detector-specific TOD now obeys the required-output policy. Config
  preflight rejects enabled output with no slots or non-detector map grouping;
  unavailable scans, PTC samples, or pointing fail at runtime instead of
  silently skipping the declared product.
- Enabled learning diagnostics now fail on open, write, flush, or close errors.
  Required Beammap PTC TOD metadata updates likewise fail when the file or
  `FRUITLOOPS_ITER` variable is unavailable.
- ECSV table output is now published atomically through a temporary file.
  Failure removes the temporary product and propagates instead of silently
  substituting a differently named ASCII table.
- `validation/accepted_runs.json` is the checked-in machine-readable validation
  ledger. Its first record captures the accepted `redu25` point checkpoint,
  including explicit unavailable provenance and the two intended metadata
  differences. A standard-library validator enforces its core consistency
  rules.
- `redu26` validates the full current Phase 1 checkpoint at `9ef7da8a`. It has
  zero serious log records, the same complete 33-file product inventory and
  merged-config hash as `redu25`, and zero changed or skipped records in the
  strict comparison including every TOD array. Total logged runtime was 59.25
  seconds versus 61.51 seconds for `redu25`; this is recorded as run variation,
  not a performance conclusion.
- Phase 2 preparation now has a checked authority inventory covering 13 config
  domains. It enforces the one-way requested-YAML to typed-config to legacy
  adapter contract and records a concrete exit gate for each domain. Seven
  domains remain materially mixed, four are typed-authoritative without an
  adapter, Beammap is typed-authoritative with one fitting adapter, and KIDs is
  an explicit external boundary. This checkpoint changes no runtime behavior;
  operational authority migration remains gated on the remaining Phase 1
  validation decisions.
- Phase 1 science validation at refactor `redu12` (`59c35e60`) completed both
  observations with 248 PTC chunks, zero logged issues, and the expected 25
  stable products. Against same-config refactor `redu10` (`9ef7da8a`), all 24
  compared FITS/NetCDF products have zero changed or skipped records. Against
  deterministic OG science `redu15`, all nine FITS products remain within the
  current tolerance, while 30 RTC/PTC diagnostic records differ under the
  generic pointwise comparator. Scientific-owner review accepted those
  differences on 2026-07-11: all integer diagnostics are exact, map RMS drift
  is at most `2.31e-11`, PTC weight RMS drift is `2.14e-12`, and the largest
  near-zero detector-median difference is `2.85e-5` absolute and `2.42e-4`
  fractional. The versioned `science-scientific-equivalence-v1` gate enforces
  the accepted bounds and the validation ledger records the checkpoint.
- The intervening science `redu11` failed after observation 0 when observation
  1 metadata loading raised an unqualified NetCDF `No such file or directory`.
  Its merged config was identical to the successful runs. Metadata-load
  failures now report observation index, name, and telescope filepath; all 220
  local tests pass. The successful `redu12` shows this was not a persistent
  numerical or lifecycle failure.
- Beammap refactor `redu10` (`f278bd32`) and `redu11` (`9ef7da8a`) use identical
  merged configs and are numerically repeatable: all six large split FITS
  products, both APT tables, RTC/PTC diagnostics, and the complete detector-TOD
  `signal`/`flags` arrays have zero changed records. The matched OG Beammap pair
  is also deterministic. Scientific-owner review accepted the bounded OG to
  refactor differences on 2026-07-11: detector identities and flags are exact;
  the worst good-detector signal and weight RMS-relative differences are
  0.625% and 0.308%; sensitivity differs by at most 0.255%; and positional and
  FWHM differences are sub-microarcsecond. The versioned
  `beammap-scientific-equivalence-v1` gate now enforces these limits and the
  validation ledger records the accepted checkpoint. Any future threshold
  breach is numerical creep and requires investigation rather than automatic
  tolerance relaxation.

## Five-Phase Roadmap

### Phase 1 - Safety Stabilization

Repair output and run-success contracts, config parsing and finite-value
validation, output schema/cardinality checks, and ordered-writer cancellation.
Add injected failure and repeated-run tests without rewriting mature numerical
algorithms.

Exit gates:

- An injected required write failure returns a nonzero CLI status.
- Ordered output cannot deadlock after failure, and partial products have an
  explicit diagnosed disposition.
- A subsequent reduction in the same process starts with clean state.
- Invalid enums, NaN, and infinity fail with actionable config paths.
- The current point run has zero unexpected error-level messages and passes a
  strict complete-TOD and metadata comparison.

### Phase 2 - Config Authority And Provenance

Build the one-way flow from immutable requested config to effective execution
plan to realized observation metadata, with a temporary one-way legacy adapter.
Fix disabled-option provenance, atomic observation config, stale beammap flux
state, and typed/legacy parity checks. Validate real TolTECA overlay behavior
before compact config becomes operational.

Exit gates are the complete current-config definition of done in section F.1 of
the external review, including one authority per migrated field, no fallback to
raw YAML in migrated execution paths, correct provenance, and reviewed overlay
fixtures for each supported reduction mode.

### Phase 3 - Library, Session, And First Compiled Boundary

Introduce a minimal non-CLI reduction session/result boundary, remove reachable
library exits, give run/observation/scan state explicit owners, and freeze
`Engine` as a compatibility adapter. Add header-isolation and multi-translation-
unit checks, repair ODR hazards, and move one measured, coherent declaration and
validation tranche into `.cpp` files.

Exit gates:

- CLI policy is outside the library boundary.
- Sequential reductions in one process are clean and supported.
- Lifecycle state is reset by ownership rather than scattered cleanup.
- The first compiled boundary reduces dependency exposure without a material
  build or runtime regression.
- Further extraction has a named ownership or contract benefit; textual
  subdivision alone is not sufficient.

### Phase 4 - Validation, Performance, And Reproducible Build

Make strict comparison and active tests pinned CI gates. Add hermetic fixtures,
version/dependency provenance, current matched mode baselines, and controlled
beammap timing and peak-memory evidence. Establish polarimetry support or an
explicit capability policy before release claims.

Exit gates are the broader structural definition of done in section F.2 of the
external review: strict scientific equivalence, zero unexpected errors,
reproducible builds, measured performance, and documented scientific
conventions.

### Phase 5 - Integration And Closeout

Consolidate canonical architecture and scientific-convention documentation,
the validation ledger, and the intended-science-change manifest. Mark or remove
legacy/stub paths, tag the forensic refactor branch, and integrate the exact
validated tree. Add install/export support only if external library consumption
is an accepted project goal.

Core RTC/PTC algorithm cleanup, broad compact-config rollout, and R execution
are follow-up projects unless their prerequisites are explicitly brought into
this roadmap.

## Stop And Defer Rules

- Stop splitting files when a split has no clear owner, contract, test seam, or
  dependency benefit.
- Do not broadly rewrite RTC/PTC, JINC, or Wiener-filter numerical kernels in
  this refactor.
- Do not make compact config authoritative before TolTECA overlay acceptance.
- Do not implement R execution before a measured-channel data contract exists.
- Do not add concurrent reductions as a requirement unless the project owner
  explicitly needs them; sequential same-process reentrancy is required.
- Do not squash or rewrite the only validated branch history.

## Decisions Requiring Scientific Ownership

Ask the project owner when implementation first depends on an answer. Do not
silently choose among these:

- Which output products are required versus optional in each reduction mode.
- Which TOD types are supported and how unknown values must fail.
- How disabled filters and extinction states appear in requested, effective,
  and realized provenance.
- The exact meaning of hardware-polarization ignore/enable controls and whether
  polarimetry is a supported release capability.
- Allowed calibration or analysis fallbacks and their required diagnostics.
- Canonical detector/network/array identities, coordinate frames, units,
  missing-value sentinels, and table schemas.
- Beammap source-flux fallback and reset behavior.
- OOF scientific intent and the acceptance tolerances for each mode.
- Whether any future caller needs concurrent reductions in one process.
- The measured-channel contract and missing-data policy for future R analysis.
- Whether Citlali must be installable and consumable as an external library.

## Durable Evidence

`validation/accepted_runs.json` is the machine-readable validation ledger. New
accepted checkpoints must record commit, binary version, mode, input/config
identity, comparator version, tolerances, error count, timing, available memory
evidence, and disposition. Run
`tools/baseline/validate_validation_ledger.py` after editing it. Continue to
update this document and the dated handoff note at phase gates and material
validation checkpoints.
